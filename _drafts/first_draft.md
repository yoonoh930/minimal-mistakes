## Motivation
I am a south Korean. It implies a lot of things. For example, I am used to hanging out until the morning. I am used to seeing a lot of places open until *super* late night or, until the following morning. And most of the time, it's fine even if you're drunk in the middle of street. It's safe in Seoul. Also I like kimchi. Kimchi has to be on the table every time I am having Korean food. I really love fried chicken. Especially when there is a beer next to it. There is even a term after the combination: [Chimaek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimaek) (chi stands for chicken and maek stands for beer in korean)

I thought, it would be fun to dig little deeper about fried chicken market and compare with other fast food markets such as pizza and hamburger. And I'd like to make a dashboard out of it. So the final product would be a some kind of dashboard that users can choose administration and the dashboard gives some insights about chicken franchises at the given location as well as other fast food markets. Let's begin.
